HPC-Scheduler-perl is a perl module abstracting the low-level interface
to batch job schedulers on HPC clusters.
A collection of end-user tools for interaction with batch job schedulers
is included in the distribution.

Up until now, a low-level interface for Sun/Oracle Grid Engine exists.

1) Perl module for interaction with the cluster/batch scheduler
===============================================================
 - checking for the queueing system's opinion about jobs
 - there's a Queueing-system neutral abstract class, and an
   implementation for Sun/Oracle Grid Engine

2) Utilities interacting with cluster/batch schedulers
======================================================
These utilities are intended as a more comfortable way to interact with
cluster schedulers, adding things such as automatic batch job dependency
management.
They provide additional metadata for the common job environment, such as
original job script names, therefore it is highly recommended to use them
for submitting/deleting/checking job_env based batch-jobs.

s_sub
--------
  submits jobs tracking dependencies
s_del
-------
  recursively deletes jobs
s_qstat
---------
  brute-forces qstat up until there is an answer
s_scheduler_wait
------------------
 waits for availability of the GridEngine master
s_stat
--------
  checks status of jobs
pbs-submitall
-------------
  submits all jobs in all subdirectories to PBS
pbs-submitall-dep
-----------------
  submits all jobs with dep-hold on jobs processed by sed regex
pbs-submitall-dep-depth
-----------------------
  submits jobs in subdirs with dependency-hold on jobs in an analog dir structure
pbs-submitall-run
-----------------
  submits a bunch of PBS jobs with rundirs
